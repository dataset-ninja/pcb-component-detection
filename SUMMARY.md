**PCB Component Detection** (PCB Component Detection) is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 1410 images with 11119 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *Cap1*, *Transformer*, *MOSFET,* and other: **Mov*, *Cap2*, *Cap3*, *Resistor*, *Cap4*, and *Resestor**.

Each image in the PCB Component Detection dataset has bounding boxes annotations. There are 114 (8% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *validation* (200 images), *train* (1099 images), and *test* (111 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 9 classes:
