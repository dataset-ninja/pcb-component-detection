**Printed Board Circuit (PCB) Component Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the waste recycling industry. 

The dataset consists of 1410 images with 11119 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *Cap1*, *Transformer*, *MOSFET*, and other: *Mov*, *Cap2*, *Cap3*, *Resistor*, *Cap4*, and *Resestor*.

Images in the PCB Component Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 114 (8% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1099 images), *validation* (200 images), and *test* (111 images). The dataset was released in 2021.
